## 818 Race Car

#### Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car/description/)

---

#### Solution 1 : BFS

- visited : used to record the state we have already arrived, because the pos not eqaul to target, so no need to add it into next_state
- pos_a < (target << 1) : double pos of the target means we also no need to record it, **we have to add a limit to pos**
- step : Do not use memo to record step, just increase it once a time

#### Code 1

> Complexity  T : O(target * log(target))   M : O(target * log(target))
