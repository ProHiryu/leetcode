#### Solution DP TLE

dp[k][n] : steps to use k eggs to detect n floors

Recrusive : dp[k][n] = min(1 + max(dp[k - 1][i - 1], dp[k][n - i])) i = 1...n. (image one egg to detect i floor)

Initial :

- dp[0][i]=0, i=1...N # no egg, no floor can check
- dp[1][i]=i, i=1...N # one egg, check floor from i to 1
- dp[j][1]=1, j=1...K # one floor, only check once

#### Follow UP : DP

dp[M][K] : given K eggs and M moves, what is the maximum number of floor that we can check.

Recrusive :

- dp[m][k] = dp[m - 1][k - 1] + dp[m - 1][k] + 1
- if egg breaks, then we can check dp[m - 1][k - 1] floors.
- if egg doesn't breaks, then we can check dp[m - 1][k] floors.

> dp[m][k] is similar to the number of combinations and it increase exponentially to N

The dp equation is:
```
dp[m][k] = dp[m - 1][k - 1] + dp[m - 1][k] + 1,
assume, dp[m-1][k-1] = n0, dp[m-1][k] = n1
the first floor to check is n0+1.
if egg breaks, F must be in [1,n0] floors, we can use m-1 moves and k-1 eggs to find out F is which one.
if egg doesn't breaks and F is in [n0+2, n0+n1+1] floors, we can use m-1 moves and k eggs to find out F is which one.
So, with m moves and k eggs, we can find out F in n0+n1+1 floors, whichever F is.
```
