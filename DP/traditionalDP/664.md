```py
class Solution(object):
    def minSwap(self, A, B):
        '''
        :type A: List[int]
        :type B: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        '''
        keep, swap = 0, 1 # keep means no need to swap i th.
        
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if A[i - 1] >= B[i] or B[i - 1] >= A[i]:
                '''
                means the manipulation of A[2] and B[2] should be same as A[1] and B[1]
                if A[1] and B[1] swap, A[2] and B[2] should swap
                So swap += 1, keep = keep
                '''
                swap += 1

                '''
                means the manipulation of A[3] and B[3] and A[2] and B[2] should be opposite.
                In this case, swap = keep + 1, keep = swap(old)
                '''
                tmp = swap

            else:
                '''
                means no need to change anything, so:
                min = min(swap, keep)

                '''
