> Complexity T : O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # use two pass scan from left to right and vice versa to keep the candy level up to now
        # similar to like the Trapping Rain Water question
        
        res = [1]*len(ratings) # also compatable with [] input
        lbase = rbase = 1
        
        # left scan
        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
            lbase = lbase + 1 if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] else 1
            res[i] = lbase
        # right scan
        for i in range(len(ratings)-2, -1, -1):
            rbase = rbase + 1 if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] else 1
            res[i] = max(rbase, res[i])
            
        return sum(res)
```
