## 406 Queue Reconstruction by Height

#### Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

---

#### Solution

- Pick out tallest group of people and sort them in a subarray (S). Since there's no other groups of people taller than them, therefore each guy's index will be just as same as his k value.
- For 2nd tallest group (and the rest), insert each one of them into (S) by k value. So on and so forth.
- E.g.
    - input: [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
    - subarray after step 1: [[7,0], [7,1]]
    - subarray after step 2: [[7,0], [6,1], [7,1]]

        queue = []
        people.sort(key = lambda x: [-x[0], x[1]])
        for p in people:
            queue.insert(p[1], p)
        return queue
