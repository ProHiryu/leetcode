#### Solution

Although this looks like a math problem, we can easily model it with graph.

Given:

`a/b = 2.0, b/c = 3.0`

We can build a directed graph:

`a -- 2.0 --> b -- 3.0 --> c`

If we were asked to find a/c, we have:

`a/c = a/b * b/c = 2.0 * 3.0`

In the graph, it is the product of costs of edges.

Do notice that, 2 edges need to added into the graph with one given equation,
because with a/b we also get result of b/a, which is the reciprocal of a/b.

so the previous example also gives edges:

`c -- 0.333 --> b -- 0.5 --> a`

Now we know how to model this problem, what we need to do is simply build the
graph with given equations, and traverse the graph, either DFS or BFS, to find a path
for a given query, and the result is the product of costs of edges on the path.

One optimization, which is not implemented in the code, is to "compress" paths for
past queries, which will make future searches faster. This is the same idea used in
compressing paths in union find set. So after a query is conducted and a result is found,
we add two edges for this query if these edges are not already in the graph.

Given the number of variables N, and number of equations E,
building the graph takes O(E), each query takes O(N), space for graph takes O(E)
