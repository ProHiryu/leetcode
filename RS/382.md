#### Solution : Follow UP

**Problem:**

- Choose k entries from n numbers. Make sure each number is selected with the probability of k/n

**Basic idea:**

- Choose 1, 2, 3, ..., k first and put them into the reservoir.
- For k+1, pick it with a probability of k/(k+1), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
- For k+i, pick it with a probability of k/(k+i), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
- Repeat until k+i reaches n

**Proof:**

- For k+i, the probability that it is selected and will replace a number in the reservoir is k/(k+i)
- For a number in the reservoir before (let's say X), the probability that it keeps staying in the reservoir is
  - P(X was in the reservoir last time) × P(X is not replaced by k+i)
  - = P(X was in the reservoir last time) × (1 - P(k+i is selected and replaces X))
  - = k/(k+i-1) × （1 - k/(k+i) × 1/k）
  - = k/(k+i)
- When k+i reaches n, the probability of each number staying in the reservoir is k/n

**Example**

- Choose 3 numbers from [111, 222, 333, 444]. Make sure each number is selected with a probability of 3/4
- First, choose [111, 222, 333] as the initial reservior
- Then choose 444 with a probability of 3/4
- For 111, it stays with a probability of
  - P(444 is not selected) + P(444 is selected but it replaces 222 or 333)
  - = 1/4 + 3/4*2/3
  - = 3/4
- The same case with 222 and 333
- Now all the numbers have the probability of 3/4 to be picked

**This Problem**

- This problem is the sp case where k=1
