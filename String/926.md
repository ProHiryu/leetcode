## Flip String to Monotone Increasing

#### Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-string-to-monotone-increasing/discuss/184080/Python-3-liner)

---

#### Solution

- We start with assuming "111.." section occupies all string, s.
- Then we update "000.." section as s[:i + 1] and "111.." section as s[i + 1:] during iteration as well as the result
- "zeros" variable counts all misplaced "0"s and "ones" variable counts all misplaced "1"s

#### Code

O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def minFlipsMonoIncr(self, s: str) -> int:
        ones = 0
        res = zeros = s.count("0")
        for c in s:
            ones, zeros = (ones + 1, zeros) if c == "1" else (ones, zeros - 1)
            res = min(res, ones + zeros)
        return res
```
