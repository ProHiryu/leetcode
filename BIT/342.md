#### Solution

Valid Number:

```
1
100
10000
1000000
100000000
10000000000
1000000000000
100000000000000
10000000000000000
1000000000000000000
100000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000
1000000000000000000000000
100000000000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000000000
1000000000000000000000000000000
```

Any other number not it the list should be considered as invalid.
So if you XOR them altogether, you will get a mask value, which is:

```
1010101010101010101010101010101 (1431655765)
```

num &(num-1) == 0 is making sure that 2 - based is not included in ans

#### Code

O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, num: int) -> bool:
        return num != 0 and num &(num-1) == 0 and num & 1431655765 == num
```
