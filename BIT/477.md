## 477 Total Hamming Distance

#### Description

#### Solution

Notice the total hamming distance is the sum of the total hamming distance for each of the i-th bits separately.

So, let's consider the i-th column, which consists of numbers chosen from {0, 1}. The total hamming distance would be the number of pairs of numbers that are different. That is,

Total hamming distance for the i-th bit =
(the number of zeros in the i-th position) *
(the number of ones in the i-th position).

We then add all of these together to get our answer.

#### Code

O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def totalHammingDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        bits = [ [0,0] for _ in range(32) ]
        for x in nums:
            for i in range(32):
                bits[i][int(x%2)] += 1
                x /= 2
        return sum( x*y for x,y in bits )
```
