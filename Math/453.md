## 453 Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

#### Description

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements/)

---

#### Solution

Let me explain why x = minNum + m
our goal is :increment minNum to be equal to maxNum

- No matter how many add operations are executed,the goal won't change.
- Every time we do the add operation,the min number in the array must participate in.
- After an add operation,the minNum is still the min number

So the minNum participate in every add operation
So x = minNum + m

#### Code

<!-- O(1) -->

```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m = sum(nums) - min(nums) * len(nums)
        return m
```
