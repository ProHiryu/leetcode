#### Solution

Operations: O(flip odds), E(flip evens), A(flip all), T(flip 3k + 1), N(flip nothing)
Relations:
O + O = N, E + E = N, A + A = N, T + T = N
O + E = A, O + A = E, E + A = O
Exclusive statuses :
n > 2:
① N
② O
③ E
④ A
⑤ T
⑥ O + T
⑦ E + T
⑧ A + T

n = 2 (remove all T related statuses):
① N
② O
③ E
④ A

n = 1(remove all T, E, A related statuses):
① N
② O

Steps needed to all status( always can plus 2 * k)
① can only be achieved by 0, 2 steps
②，③，④ can be achieved by either 1 or 2 steps
⑤ can only be achieved by 1 steps
⑥，⑦，⑧ can only be achieved by 2 steps,

Thus:
0 steps -> ①
1 steps -> ②，③，④，⑤
2 steps -> ①，②，③，④，⑥，⑦，⑧
more than 2 steps -> ①, ②, ③, ④, ⑤, ⑥, ⑦, ⑧

#### Code

<!-- O(n) -->

```python
class Solution:
    def flipLights(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        m, n = min(3, m), min(3, n)
        return 1 if n == 0 or m == 0 else self.flipLights(n - 1,  m) + self.flipLights( n - 1, m - 1)
```
