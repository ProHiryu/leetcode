## Permutation Sequence

#### Solution

For permutations of n, the first (n-1)! permutations start with 1, next (n-1)! ones start with 2, ... and so on. And in each group of (n-1)! permutations, the first (n-2)! permutations start with the smallest remaining number, ...

take n = 3 as an example, the first 2 (that is, (3-1)! ) permutations start with 1, next 2 start with 2 and last 2 start with 3. For the first 2 permutations (123 and 132), the 1st one (1!) starts with 2, which is the smallest remaining number (2 and 3). So we can use a loop to check the region that the sequence number falls in and get the starting digit. Then we adjust the sequence number and continue.

每次确定该数字是处于按照当前第一个数字来划分的第几组，将对应位置的数字填入就行了

**Because to get the k-th sequence, you only need to perform (k-1) transformation, as number is initialized as range(1, n+1) which is already the 1st term**

#### Code

O(nlogn)

```python
class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        import math
        res = ""
        nums = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        k -= 1
        while n > 0:
            n -= 1
            lens = math.factorial(n)
            i, k = k // lens, k % lens
            res += str(nums[i])
            nums.remove(nums[i])
        
        return res
```
